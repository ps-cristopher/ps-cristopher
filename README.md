I am passionate about technological innovation and digital transformation, I focus on the development and optimization of web solutions, with experience in creating several kinds of multiplatform apps like multi-page apps, single-page applications, progressive web applications, hybrid applications, and CMS sites as well as e-commerce. I currently perform better with TypeScript and JavaScript, using frameworks such as Vue, Nuxt, and React for creating applications in the  frontend side, years ago I was programming full stack with Java.
